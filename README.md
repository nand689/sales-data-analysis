ðŸ“Œ Project Summary â€“ Sales Data Analysis
   This project focuses on exploring and analyzing a sales dataset to uncover meaningful business insights. The analysis follows a structured approach:
                  1. Data Cleaning & Preparation :Removed irrelevant columns (e.g., Zipcode)
                                                  Handled missing and null values
                                                  Ensured correct data types for accurate analysis
                  2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Generated summary statistics to understand dataset structure
                                                      Visualized sales trends using Matplotlib and Seaborn
                                                      Explored relationships between product categories, regions, and sales performance
                  3. Insights & Findings : Identified top-performing product categories and regions
                                           Observed seasonal and time-based sales trends
                                           Highlighted areas for potential business improvement
ðŸ’» Tools & Libraries Used:
                 Python: Data cleaning & analysis
